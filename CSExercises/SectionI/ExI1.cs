    //3 dollars 50 cents (inputted as 3.50).  Further assume that we would 
    //always input nearest to 5 cents (i.e., values like 2.23 are not keyed in).  
    //The duty of your program is to dispense this amount (accurately!) using a combination of 
    //coins.  We have coins of denomination 100, 50, 20, 10 and 5 cents.  More than one coin of 
    //a denomination can be used.  
    //Yeah I know what you are thinking – simply issue all five cent coins; right?  
    //Cannot!- easy but no challenge.  
    //We are requesting the program to use the “minimum number of coins” principle.  
    //For example, if a request were made for 1.95 then the computer would issue one 100-cent coin, 
    //one 50-cent coin, two 20-cent coins and one 5-cent coin.  

    //The trick is to always start with the largest denomination and slowly go down.
